# Running an Angular Project

This README.md guide provides instructions on how to run an Angular project from scratch. Whether you're starting a new project or collaborating with others, these steps will help you set up and run the Angular project seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: Angular requires Node.js to be installed. You can download and install it from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm usually comes with Node.js installation.

## Installation

1. **Install Angular CLI**:

   Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of creating and managing Angular projects.

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Angular CLI globally:

   ```
   npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

2. **Clone the Angular project repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ferreirajose/sisdegt.git
    ```

## Running the Project

1. **Start the development server:**

    ```
    npm start
    ```


2. **Accessing the project in the browser:**

    ```
    http://localhost:4200/
    ```

3. **Run unit tests:**
    
    ```
    npm run test
    ```
4. **Build the project:**
    ```
    ng build --prod
    ```

## Problems with installing dependencies

  try downloading using the command below
  
  ```
   npm i --legacy-peer-deps
  ```
